# Creative Mayhem LTD: Case Studies & Advisory Index

## Architectural Governance & Regulatory Implementation

Creative Mayhem LTD provides high-level architectural advisory for organizations facing complex regulatory hurdles. We operate on a single core principle: **Compliance is an engineering challenge, not an administrative one.**

With more than 30 years of experience navigating critical infrastructure, fintech, and telecom—including digital work archived at **SF MoMA**, the **Guggenheim**, and the **Museum of the Moving Image**—we move beyond "Policy-by-PDF" into functional, audit-ready architecture.

### Featured Case Study: EU AI Act Implementation

#### [Operationalizing EU AI Act Compliance: Sortalizer](./EU_AI_COMPLIANCE_SORTALIZER_CASE_STUDY.md)
**Focus:** Article 50 (Transparency) and Annex IV (Technical Documentation).
**Objective:** A deep-dive into the architectural shift required to meet the December 2025 Code of Practice. While legal teams debate theory, we have operationalized compliance for Sortalizer by building machine-readable provenance and automated labeling directly into the product stack. This study serves as a benchmark for moving from "Limited Risk" theory to technical reality.
